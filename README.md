SoftwareDevLifecycle Module 8 Assignment



As a software developer, it's essential to interpret the needs of users and translate them into a program. One way to do this is by creating user stories that outline the user's goals and needs for a specific feature. These user stories help to keep the user at the center of the development process and ensure that the final product meets their requirements. When developing programs, I like to incorporate agile processes like Scrum. These methodologies prioritize collaboration, flexibility, and development. Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, active participation in meetings, willingness to learn from others, and respecting team members' opinions and expertise.
